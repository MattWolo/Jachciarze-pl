Our graduation school project involved a group of students, including myself, focusing on meeting a client's needs. The project is based on renting, booking, and allowing users to send emails directly to support through the website. There is also the option to create an account and reset a password. NOTE: Some of these functions may not work due to the MySQL database being disconnected.
